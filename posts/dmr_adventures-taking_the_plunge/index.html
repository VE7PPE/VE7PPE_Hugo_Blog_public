<p>Having a number of analogue VHF/UHF radios, and spending most/all of my time on HF, I really didn&rsquo;t see the need to branch into digital VHF/UHF.</p>
<p>A few things fueled my curiosity this past Spring:</p>
<ul>
<li>HF SSB voice was not fun.  I run QRP+ by choice, like low power energy portable, and I get tired of competing with foot stomping linear activating massive beam stations to just hear one side of a conversation.  Cubic $/equipment/power.  Yet I missed the conversations</li>
<li>Almost complete silence of the local analogue repeaters.  There was a daily morning 2m net from Port Angeles that was more of a round-table that was nice to hear others during COVID lock down, but it has disappeared from the airwaves.  The few other local nets are quite dry (boring cryptic) check-ins, aka I had no interest in taking the time to participate</li>
<li>Because we were putting our Victoria house on the market, and planned to move to the North Okanagan in BC, I had packed all my HF gear and pulled my EFRW HF antenna down.</li>
<li>I kept my Kenwood TH-D72 out to maybe play with some APRS, packet, or Winmail.  But I ultimately found it not very satisfying, I wanted to hear voices and speak with fellow hams</li>
<li>I decided to reread up on the non-HF digital modes, including D-Star, Fusion, and DMR.  My FT-991A does Fusion, so started there, but I am a many decades Unix and Open-Source user/sysadmin. Zero interest in proprietary software/hardware if possible, particularly running exclusively in the Windows environment.  Been burned by lock-in in the past</li>
<li>Over the years, D-Star has intrigued me, but just couldn&rsquo;t justify the cost of ICOM D-Star radio that provided the full feature set including high-speed data</li>
<li>Local ham had an Anytone 878UVII+ for sale that he only used in analogue as support for the local marathon running events. It was pristine and still in its box with a hand mic. The AnytoneUVII+ would be a solid foundation to start my DMR adventures</li>
</ul>
<p>So went full in studying up on DMR and the Anytone 878 radio, sold myself on the &ldquo;need&rdquo; for another radio, and bought the radio with barely a clue of even how to use the radio.  Learned it had GPS and BT, worked on APRS &amp; D-APRS, but had no idea how to program it or how to even get on a local DMR repeater.  Jumping in the deep end here.</p>
<p>DMR has a steep learning curve between programming the radio, building a hotspot, accessing local repeaters, finding TalkGroups and understanding the flow of QSOs.  Sounds like modern Ham Radio, sign me up.</p>
<p>So far DMR has lived up to its billing, provides a DX type of SSB-like voice with a simple low cost HT.  Perfect for many hams - apartment dwellers, older hams in assisted living, mobile, or having particular interests to discuss using radio to reach out around the world.</p>
